[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

[![Build Status]]((0.0.17)](https://pypi.org/project/druida/))

Druida is an artificial intelligence developed support the metasurfaces design process.

- Generative pipelines for metasurfaces design
The goal is to provide a stable version of the most important algorithmic pipelines to train and deploy AI for metasurfaces design.

## Features

- Deep Neural Network Stack
- GAN Generator Stack
- GAN Discriminator Stack
- Unconditional Diffusion Model
- Conditional Diffusion Model

## Goals
> Configurable AI models
> Easy to interface and use through jupyter notebooks.
> Reproduceable models
> API to future hyperparameters optimization



## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Python] - Python 3.
- [PyTorch] - The framework to build our algorithms.
- [CLIP] - Pipelione to produce word encoding.


## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production node app
```

## Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:

```sh
node app
```

Second Tab:

```sh
gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:

```sh
karma test
```

#### Building for source

For production release:

```sh
gulp build --prod
```

Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:

```sh
gulp build dist --prod
```

## Docker

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
